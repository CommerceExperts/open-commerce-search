## Open Commerce Search Stack

The Open Commerce Search Stack (OCSS) is a small abstraction layer on top of existing open source search solutions (Elasticsearch, Lucene and Querqy) that removes the hastle of dealing with the details of information retrieval. It was designed to handle most problems of search in e-commerce using known best practices. 
The API first approach aims for simplicity and broad adaption.
[More information about the motivation and background of OCSS can be found in our blog](https://blog.searchhub.io/introducing-open-commerce-search-stack-ocss).
